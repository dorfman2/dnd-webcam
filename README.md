# D&D Web Controlled Camera

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZKOud8q.png)

This project is to run a web camera pan and tilt function that can be controlled by multiple users via web interface. 

This project is still under early development. It currently only runs via hardware switches locally. It will eventually utilize Python + Flask.

I'm creating this project so that my D&D group can move the camera to examine the 3D landscapes used in our sessions. As each person takes a turn during combat, they can be given control.
